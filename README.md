## Project Description
Stress is one of the most common challenges faced by students today, influencing their academic and personal life. When stress levels become excessive, they can contribute greatly to mental health issues, lower productivity, and poor performance. To address the problem, we can apply two core data analysis approaches: classification and clustering.

For classification: Our objective is to build predictive models that categorize students into stress levels.

As for clustering: In addition to prediction, we will group students with similar profiles into clusters. This allows us to uncover hidden patterns. 

Using such methods helps provide insights into different stress profiles and helps develop more targeted coping strategies.

## Project Motivation
The goal of our project is to help educational institutions in identifying students who are at risk because of extreme stress. Through understanding the founding factors of stress, we aim to help institutions provide quick and appropriate support, making sure that students can manage stress and perform at their best.
