        "\n",
        "-Classification: Build predictive models to categorize students into stress levels (Low, Moderate, High) using features related to psychological state, academic workload, social interactions, environment, and physiological indicators.\n",

        "-Clustering: Group students with similar profiles to uncover hidden patterns, such as students mainly stressed by academic pressure versus those affected by social or environmental conditions. This will provide insights into different stress profiles and support the development of more targeted coping strategies.\n",
